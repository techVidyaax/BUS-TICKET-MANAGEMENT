# BUS TICKET MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This is a simple **Bus Ticket Management System** developed as a beginner-level project to understand frontend and backend integration. It was my 2nd year capstone project.

The project was initially created using only HTML and CSS for the frontend. Later, backend functionality was added using **Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB** to manage user authentication and ticket booking.

This project is mainly built for learning purposes and future reference, so that the complete flow of a full-stack application can be easily remembered and understood.
