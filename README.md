##BUS TICKET MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This is a simple Bus Ticket Management System developed as a beginner-friendly project to understand both frontend and backend integration.

The project was initially built using only HTML and CSS for the frontend. Later, a backend was added using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to handle user authentication and ticket booking.

This project is mainly created for learning purposes and for future reference, so that I can recall the projects I have worked on and understand the complete flow of a web application.
